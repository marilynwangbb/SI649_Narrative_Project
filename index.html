<h2 style="text-align: center;">Inclusion and Diversity Analysis on Umich Admission Data</h2>
<body style="margin: 15px;">
  <p style="margin: 15px;">
    In higher education, the need for inclusivity and gender equity has become an urgent call to which institutions must respond. The University of Michigan has not only heard this call but has also positioned itself at the front, actively advocating for and fostering a diverse academic community. Our in-depth analysis of the university's admissions data showcase the multifaceted nature of ethnicity and gender distribution, offering a snapshot of the evolving demographic landscape of the university. Despite the university's extensive efforts to champion diversity and inclusion, our findings suggest that the journey is far from complete. As the University of Michigan continues to forge paths toward greater diversity, it becomes evident that sustained and innovative policies are crucial to widen the breadth of inclusion. We will examine this issue from two aspects: 1. gender equality in admission, 2. Ethnicity representation in admission.

  <h3 style="margin: 10px;">Gender Equality </h3>
  <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Gender of Top 30 Universities</h4>
  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    Gender biases often arise during the application and admissions process, a concern many families share. For instance, certain majors like science and engineering tend to favor boys, while liberal arts may lean towards girls. Additionally, disparities in admission rates based on gender, even with similar credentials, are not uncommon.
    To navigate potential gender-related rejections, it's crucial for students to research the admission trends of each university they apply to in the US. Which institutions show a gender imbalance in their student body? Are they inclined towards admitting boys or girls? Armed with this information, students can make informed decisions when selecting where to apply.
    To provide clarity, we ha've compiled the latest freshman enrollment data from the official websites of the top 30 comprehensive universities in the United States, shedding light on the gender ratios among incoming undergraduates.

  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    It can be found that there is indeed an obvious gender imbalance in American universities. There are even three universities where the difference in the ratio of male to female freshmen is astonishingly more than 20%:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin: 20px;">
    <li>University of California, Los Angeles: 21%</li>
    <li>University of California, Davis: 22%</li>
    <li>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: 24%</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin: 20px;">In addition, there are 6 universities with a gap of more than 10% in the ratio of male to female freshmen:</p>

  <ul style="margin: 20px;">
    <li>University of California, Berkeley: 12%</li>
    <li>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor: 12%</li>
    <li>Georgetown University: 14%</li>
    <li>Emory University: 16%</li>
    <li>University of Virginia: 14%</li>
    <li>University of Florida: 14%</li>
  </ul>

<p style="margin: 20px;">Some of these universities prefer girls, and some prefer boys.</p>

  <h3 style="margin: 10px;">Ethnicity Representation </h3>
  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    Our data depicting the ethnic distribution of first-time admissions at the University of Michigan from 2018 to 2023 reveals significant trends and shifts. Notably, the proportion of White, non-Hispanic students has shown a steady decline from slightly over 55% in 2018 to just under the 50% threshold by 2023. Despite this decline, White students maintain a predominant presence, outnumbering the next largest group, Asian, non-Hispanic students, by approximately 30%.
    A pivotal change is observed starting in the 2020-2021 academic year, marked by a distinct rise in the Hispanic/Latino student population. This upward trajectory stands out as the primary factor contributing to the relative decrease in White student representation, while other ethnic groups remain relatively stable without significant increase.
    While there is a clear intention to foster cultural diversity and inclusivity, the growth in representation for non-White populations is gradual. The significant increase in Hispanic/Latino student representation beginning in 2020-2021 indicates progress; however, for most other ethnic groups, the numbers suggest that current efforts primarily serve to maintain rather than expand diversity. This points to a potential need for more impactful strategies and initiatives to not only sustain but also actively enhance the representation of students from diverse backgrounds. As the university continues to navigate the complexities of creating a truly inclusive educational environment, we suggest modifying policies and carrying out practices that aim at broadening cultural representation within its student body.

  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    Amidst these efforts, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as an unforeseen disruptor, vividly affecting admission patterns, especially among nonresident alien students. Their decreasing numbers during the peak of the pandemic reflect the direct impact of international travel restrictions and global uncertainty. However, the tentative recovery seen in the data from 2021 onwards offers a glimpse of resilience and adjustment as the situation improves.
    Therefore we zoomed in on looking at the undergraduate admission count for resident and nonresident students.
    During this five-year span, the number of resident students has generally followed an ascending path and less fluctuation. The peak of this growth was observed in the 2021-2022 academic year, with an admission count of 6,884 resident students.
    In contrast, the pattern for nonresident student admissions has been far less steady, with pronounced year-to-year variations. Most notable among these was the downturn during the 2020-2021 academic year. This decline aligns temporally with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought about extensive travel restrictions and an unprecedented shift towards remote learning—a combination that undeniably impacted the enrollment of nonresident students. Yet, as the remote policies were lifted, a robust resurgence in nonresident admissions occurred in 2021-2022, with their numbers climbing to 407. The durability of this recovery is evidenced by the figures from 2022-2023.
    Our close-up examination on the admissions data at the University of Michigan provides a clearer picture of the university’s international student body. Notably, students possessing an A visa account for no more than 5% of the total admissions. This figure falls slightly below the national average of 5.6% international student representation typically seen at colleges and universities across the United States. Such a statistic highlights a distinct feature of the university's student demographic, emphasizing a strong local and regional appeal over international attraction.

  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    One notable trend is the steady presence of nonresident aliens, with a slight annual increase from 7.00% in 2018-2019 to 8.37% in 2022-2023, indicating a gradual rise in international diversity within the student body. When clicking on specific ethnic groups, the visualization offers an additional layer of detail, revealing the division between first-time admissions, presumably including incoming freshmen, and non-first-time admissions, which likely consist of transfer students or those continuing their studies. The non-first-time admission student contribute more significantly to the increase in representation of nonresident aliens than other ethical group. As other ethical groups have less than 1% non-first-time admission student. This finding suggests a potential change in the university's composition or a strategic shift in admissions policies that favor transfer or continuing nonresident students.
    Our visualization underscores the multifaceted nature of achieving diversity and inclusivity in higher education. As the university strides towards a more heterogeneous campus, the insights reveal that diversity efforts extend beyond just first-time admissions. The differences in representation between first-time and non-first-time students highlight the importance of a holistic approach. It is evident that cultivating a truly diverse academic community requires consideration of multiple entry points and student backgrounds.

  <h3 style="margin: 10px;">Criteria-based admission and Enrollment Condition</h3>
  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    Over the past five years, the number of applicants to the University of Michigan has trended downward and then upward, and the gender ratio of acceptance rates has changed, with men outnumbering women for the first time in the 2022-2023 enrollment.
The university reviews the past five years of admissions, high school grades and GPA is still the most important measurement dimensions, standardized test scores, application documents, personal qualities, and whether the first-generation college students are also very important. Applicants are asked to carefully prepare materials that highlight academic performance and personal attributes beyond academics.
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    Gender and ethnic equity are important components of educational equity. These two indicators often play an important role in assessing the university's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) metrics.
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 20px;">
    When analyzing the nationality composition of students currently enrolled at the University of Michigan, it can be seen that, in addition to Michigan, the largest source of domestic students in the United States, there are also a large number of students from California, Illinois and New York, which may be related to the quality of the source of students in each state, the size of the population, as well as and the geographic proximity to the State of Michigan factors. The highest percentage of international students come from China, India, and Canada, with Chinese students being the largest. Excluding Canada, which is geographically close to the U.S., Chinese and Indian students are eager to attend the University of Michigan, which may be related to the fact that competition for educational resources is fierce in these two countries with large populations.
Regarding the gender composition of enrolled students, most international student sources have more male than female international students. The same is true within the U.S. itself, with only a few states (e.g., New York) having a ratio of males to females close to 1:1. However, in the state of Michigan, which is the top source of students for the University of Michigan, the number of enrolled females is significantly higher than the number of enrolled males.
